      question: "How long before we see results from SEO?",
      answer: "SEO is a long-term investment, you typically start seeing measurable ranking improvements in 3–4 months, with significant traffic growth by month 5–6. For competitive industries, 12 months is a realistic timeline for dominant rankings. We set honest expectations from day one and provide monthly progress reports showing ranking movement, traffic trends, and domain authority growth.",

      question: "What is the minimum ad spend required for Google or Meta Ads?",
      answer: "For Google Ads, we recommend a minimum monthly ad spend of ₹50,000 to generate meaningful data and results. For Meta Ads, ₹30,000 per month is the minimum effective budget. These are ad spend budgets paid directly to Google/Meta, separate from our management fee. We can work with lower budgets for testing phases.",
